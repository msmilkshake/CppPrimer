std::cout << "The sum of " << v1;
<< " and " << v2;
<< " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;

The code above is lot legal because of the following:

- The first line is a valid complete statement, which ends with a semicolon.
If the value of variable v1 is 10, it outputs: "The sum of 10".

- The second and third lines are both invalid. The first occourence of operator
<< in both lines don't have a left hand operand, making it invalid. To fix this,
we should add at the beginning of each line the ostream object: "std::cout".

Code with suggested fixes:

std::cout << "The sum of " << v1;
std::cout << " and " << v2;
std::cout << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;
